        Could not locate a local Parallels Tools iso file.
        Please configure a local path to the iso using `config.prltools.iso_path`
        in your Vagrantfile or the `--iso` command line option.
        If you think this is a bug and vagrant-parallels-tools could have guessed the iso_path,
        please file an issue at: https://github.com/wizonesolutions/vagrant-parallels-tools/issues
